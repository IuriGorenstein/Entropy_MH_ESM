The data available here is described in: "The Atlantic Ocean’s Decadal Variability in mid-Holocene
Simulations using Shannon’s Entropy" - paper currently under review by the GMD Journal.

The data contemplates sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation indexes that correspond to 17 simulation runs from four numerical climate models (EC-Earth, iCESM, CCSM-Toronto, and GISS).
In the paper cited above, this data is used to study decadal climate variability of the tropical and South Atlantic,
and its sensibility to prescribed parametrizations in pre-industrial and mid-Holocene simulations.

Furthermore, the code necessary to plot the data, create the directed graphs and compute Shannon's Entropy present in the manuscript are also shared in this repository.

Due to its large size, the data available here is the SST and PPT indexes in the reduced phase-space of the three EOFs (three principal components) of the data-set.
The calculation of this phase-space is accessible via the scipy and scikitlearn libraries.
An example of how this PCA can be applied to a test_dataset was also made available here.

I appologise for the usage of portuguese in the code. The translation will be completed in due time.

The complete data set of simulations, including the complete time series of the of sea surface temperature and precipitation,
other variables and the complete NetCDF files of the global simulations are available upon reasonable request (contact iuri.gorenstein@usp.br).
