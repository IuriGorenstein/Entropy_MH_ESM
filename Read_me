The data available here is described in: "The Atlantic Ocean’s Decadal Variability in mid-Holocene
Simulations using Shannon’s Entropy" - paper currently under review in GMD Journal.

The data comes from 17 simulations from four numerical climate models (EC-Earth, iCESM, CCSM-Toronto, and GISS).
In the paper cited above, the data is used to study decada climate variability of the tropical and South Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and precipitation,
and its sensibility to prescribed parametrizations in pre-industrial and mid-Holocene simulations.

Further more, the code necessary to plot the data, create the directed graphs and compute Shannon's Entropy are also shared in this repository.
